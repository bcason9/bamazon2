# Bamazon

This app is meant to run in Node JS using mySQL for database support. It is a mock-shopping app which allows users to purchase items from the database. It is currently still in development.

# Dependencies

Requires npm inquirer, mySQL, and npm install of package-JSON.

# Future Development

This app is not currently in a working state but it will be completed soon. Unfortunately I did not have time to get it working with the current homework deadline, so much of the JS is psuedocoded to reflect the next stages of development.
